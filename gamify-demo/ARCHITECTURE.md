# Gamify Demo Application: Architecture Guide

This document describes the key architectural patterns and design decisions used in the Gamify Demo application.

## 1. Overview

The Gamify Demo application follows a layered architecture, common in Spring Boot applications, with distinct responsibilities for presentation (frontend), application logic (backend services), and data persistence (repositories). It leverages several key design patterns to promote modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.

## 2. Key Architectural Patterns

### 2.1. Command Pattern (in Task Processing)

The application uses the Command pattern to encapsulate task-related operations.

**Purpose:**

* **Decoupling:** Separates the object that invokes an operation (controller) from the object that performs the operation (command)
* **Encapsulation:** Treats requests as objects, making them easier to parameterize, queue, and log
* **Undo/Redo Support:** Enables potential undo/redo functionality

**Components:**

* **Command Interface:** `TaskCommand` with `execute()` method
* **Concrete Commands:** `CompleteTaskCommand`, `CreateTaskCommand`, `DeleteTaskCommand`
* **Invoker:** Controller or service that triggers command execution
* **Receiver:** Service class that performs the actual operation

### 2.2. Strategy Pattern (for Points and Achievements)

The Strategy pattern is used for calculating points and determining achievement unlocks.

**Purpose:**

* **Flexibility:** Interchangeable algorithms at runtime
* **Extensibility:** New strategies can be added without modifying existing code
* **Maintainability:** Avoids complex conditional logic

**Components:**

* **Strategy Interface:** `TaskPointsCalculationStrategy`
* **Concrete Strategies:** `PriorityBasedPointsStrategy`, `DifficultyBasedPointsStrategy`
* **Context:** Service class that uses the strategy

### 2.3. Event-Driven Architecture

The application uses an event-driven approach for notifications and asynchronous processing.

**Key Aspects:**

* **Event Generation:** Key actions trigger events
* **Event Objects:** Java objects extending `DomainEvent`
* **Event Publisher:** Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher`
* **Event Listeners:** `@EventListener` methods in services

## 3. Technology Stack

### Backend
- Spring Boot (Java)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Hibernate (ORM)
- JWT (Authentication)

### Frontend
- JavaScript (Main logic)
- HTML/CSS (Presentation)

### Infrastructure
- SSL/TLS (Secure connections)
- HikariCP (Connection pooling)

## 4. Configuration

Key configuration aspects from `application.properties`:

- **Database:** PostgreSQL with SSL
- **JPA:** Hibernate with SQL logging
- **Security:** JWT authentication
- **Error Handling:** Clean error responses
- **Static Resources:** Served from `/static`

## 5. Future Considerations

- Add API versioning
- Implement rate limiting
- Add monitoring and metrics
- Consider caching for frequent queries
- Implement proper logging strategy
