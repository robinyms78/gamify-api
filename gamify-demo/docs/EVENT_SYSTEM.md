# Gamify Demo Application: Event System Documentation

This document describes the event system used within the Gamify Demo application. This system allows different parts of the application to react to significant occurrences within the application's lifecycle.

## 1. Overview

The Gamify Demo application utilizes an event-driven architecture within the Spring framework. Key actions within the application trigger events, which are then broadcast to any interested subscribers. This promotes loose coupling between components.

**Key Components:**

* **Event Objects:** Events are represented as Java objects extending Spring's `ApplicationEvent` class
* **Event Publisher:** Spring's `ApplicationEventPublisher` is used to publish events
* **Event Listeners:** Components use `@EventListener` annotation to handle specific event types

## 2. Event Types

The following table describes the likely event types within the system:

| Event Type          | Trigger                                      | Data Payload (Assumed)                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PointsEarnedEvent   | When a user earns points for completing task | userId, points, taskId, timestamp                                                    |
| TaskCompletedEvent  | When a user completes a task                 | userId, taskId, taskData, timestamp                                                  |
| UserRegisteredEvent | When a new user registers                   | userId, username, timestamp                                                          |

## 3. Event Subscription

Components subscribe to events using Spring's `@EventListener` annotation:

```java
@Service
public class PointsService {

    @EventListener
    public void handlePointsEarned(PointsEarnedEvent event) {
        // Update leaderboard, send notifications, etc.
    }
}
```

## 4. Configuration

The event system requires no explicit configuration in `application.properties` as it uses Spring's built-in event mechanism.

## 5. Best Practices

1. Keep event handlers idempotent
2. Use `@Async` for long-running event handlers
3. Implement proper error handling in listeners
4. Keep event payloads minimal and focused
5. Document all event types and their purposes

## 6. Future Considerations

- Add message broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for distributed events
- Implement event versioning
- Add event auditing/logging
- Consider event sourcing pattern
