# Gamify Demo Application: Workflow Guide

This guide describes the key workflows within the Gamify Demo application, from user registration to earning points and viewing your progress.

## 1. User Registration Process

This section outlines how a new user joins the Gamify Demo application.

**Steps:**

1.  **Access Registration:** The user likely navigates to a registration page (e.g., a link on the main website or within a mobile app). The exact entry point isn't visible to me, but it's a standard practice.

2.  **Provide Information:** The user is presented with a registration form.  Based on the `User` model, the required information likely includes:
    *   Username (unique)
    *   Password
    *   Department
    *   Email (This is inferred, but a very common requirement)
    *   Other relevant user details

3.  **Account Creation:** The user submits the form. The application backend:
    *   **Validates** the input (checks for uniqueness of username, password strength, etc. - best practices).
    *   **Creates** a new `User` record in the database.
    *   **May send** a confirmation email (common practice, but not explicitly shown in the code).

4.  **Login (Optional):** The user may be automatically logged in after successful registration, or they may need to log in separately using their newly created credentials.

**Prerequisites:**

*   A working internet connection.
*   A valid email address (likely, for confirmation and potential password recovery).

**System Limitations:**

*   **Username Uniqueness:** The system enforces unique usernames. If a chosen username is already taken, the user will need to choose a different one.
*   **Password Requirements:** There are likely password strength requirements (e.g., minimum length, required character types) that are not explicitly detailed here but are standard security practices.

## 2. Completing a Task and Earning Points

This section describes how a user completes a task within the application and earns points.

**Steps:**

1.  **Task Selection/Assignment:** The user selects or is assigned a task. The mechanism for this isn't clear from the provided code (it could be a task list, a project board, etc.).

2.  **Task Completion:** The user performs the actions required to complete the task.

3.  **Task Submission/Marking as Complete:** The user indicates that the task is finished. This might involve clicking a button, submitting a form, or some other action within the application's UI.

4.  **Event Generation:** The application generates a `TaskEvent` (and likely a corresponding `TaskEventDTO`). This event records details about the completed task.

5.  **Points Calculation:**
    *   The system determines the appropriate `TaskPointsCalculationStrategy` (e.g., `PriorityBasedPointsStrategy`).
    *   The `calculatePoints` method of the chosen strategy is called, using the `taskId` and `eventData` to determine the points awarded.

6.  **Points Awarding:**
    *   A `PointsEarnedEvent` is created, recording the user, points earned, and other relevant information.
    *   The user's `earnedPoints` in the `User` model are updated.
    *   The `Leaderboard` entry for the user is updated via the `syncWithUser` method.

7.  **Notification (Likely):** The user likely receives a notification informing them of the points earned and any related updates (e.g., level increase). This would probably use the `NotificationService`.

**Prerequisites:**

*   The user must be registered and logged in.
*   There must be available tasks to complete.

**System Limitations:**

*   **Task Definition:** The exact nature of "tasks" is not fully defined here. It's assumed to be a general concept, but the specific types and attributes of tasks are application-dependent.
*   **Point Strategy Availability:** The system relies on having appropriate `TaskPointsCalculationStrategy` implementations available.

## 3. Viewing Achievements/Ladder Status

This section describes how a user can view their progress within the gamification system.

**Steps:**

1.  **Access Profile/Dashboard:** The user navigates to a section of the application that displays their profile or a gamification dashboard (the exact UI element is unknown).

2.  **Ladder Status Display:**
    *   The user's current ladder level is displayed. This is likely calculated based on their `earnedPoints` and the defined level thresholds.
    *   Progress towards the next level might be shown (e.g., a progress bar).
    *   The user's position on the leaderboard is likely displayed, fetched from the `Leaderboard` data.

3.  **Achievement Display:**
    *   A list of unlocked achievements is displayed. This likely involves fetching data associated with the user (details not shown in the provided code).
    *   Locked achievements might also be displayed, along with the criteria required to unlock them.

**Prerequisites:**

*   The user must be registered and logged in.

**System Limitations:**

*   **Real-time Updates:** The displayed information might not update in real-time. It's possible there's a slight delay between earning points/unlocking achievements and seeing the changes reflected in the UI.
*   **Achievement Tracking:** The specific mechanisms for tracking and storing achievement progress are not detailed in the provided code snippets.
